# TO-DO-APP

A simple to do app in React.js (+Redux) I did to see the basics of how React works and to start using Git and GitHub for real. I followed along with one of extensive Udemy courses on React I bought and changed some CSS to make the app look more the way I wanted.

The app allows you to add, check/uncheck and search your to dos.

To run the app you first need to:
- Have Node.js installed,
- Run the npm install command to install node modules listed in package.json locally,
- Run the npm start command to run the server.
